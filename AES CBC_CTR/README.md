#AES CBC and CTR decrypting ciphertext

Given two examples of ciphertext generated with the same key using AES-128-CBC this program will decrypt both ciphertexts.

Given two examples of ciphertext generated with the same key using AES-128-CTR this program will decrypt both ciphertexts.

Will take ciphertext and key in hex values and transform it into bytes to find readable plaintext
